# We're getting hitched

{% include photo.html %}
**Sara Blaise Huddleston** and **Andrew Berns Rossmeissl** cordially invite you to their honeymoon **March 14–24** on the island of **Grenada**.

## Wait, what?

Yeah we know it's pretty weird. We wrote you this letter to try to explain what's going on here.

## Honeymoon

When
: **March 14–24, 2019**. Come anytime in this window and stay for as long as you'd like. Most people will come Friday March 15 and stay for a long weekend so they don't miss the [party](#party).

Where
: **Grenada, West Indies**. Grenada is a small island but most of what we plan to do is concentrated in the southwest around Grand Anse Beach.

Think of this like a spring break trip where a bunch of your friends and family will also be there. Other than the [party](#party), there's no schedule, so you'll have plenty of time to relax and do your thing.

## Party

When
: **March 16, 2019 at 5:30pm**. Things should be wrapped up by midnight.

Where
: **Beach Cabana, Mount Cinnamon Resort**.

What
: **Food, drink and music**. There will also be a **ceremony**.

Who
: **No young children, please**. We'll have information forthcoming on what to do with your kiddos.

Dress
: **Beach semi-formal**. More than jeans, less than tuxedos.

We're getting married in a tiny chapel in Wisconsin that's a memorial to Sara Blaise's grandmother. There's only enough room for family, so this is our chance to celebrate with all of you.
