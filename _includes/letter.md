Dear friends and family,

You read that right: you're invited to our honeymoon. Let us explain.

From our very first vacation together in Kauai to our (frankly pretty tame) spring breaks in Miami to our _passagiatti_ in Sicily, we have relished the unhurried magic of discovering a new place. Many of our favorite times with all of you have likewise found us in repose rather than on a schedule: blissful apres-hike afternoons in Vermont, strolls around the Madison farmer's market, long walks through museums everywhere.

Since we were engaged last October (during one of those very Vermont hikes), our wedding plans have zigged and zagged. But we've returned time and again to the vision of a vacation we all happen to take at the same time, to the same place.

We've never been to Grenada; maybe you haven't either. We will certainly be throwing a party one night, including rings and a dress and a few brief vows, but there will be no other formal schedule. It's our hope that we can all explore this beautiful place together, in parallel, or even just nearby. We'll be there for 10 days: feel free to join us for as many or as few of any of these days that you'd like.

This is a honeymoon, not a wedding: no presents! Spend the money on sunscreen. Please also don't feel bad if this isn't your thing, or if you can't come. We won't take it personally and promise to come visit you soon for a private vows recital. If, on the other hand, you're thinking of planning a winter getaway somewhere warm, consider this time and place. We'd love to see you.

XOX,
Sara Blaise and Andy
