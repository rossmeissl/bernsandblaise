## Travel

Generally speaking, the easiest and most affordable option will be to take one of JetBlue's daily nonstop flights from JFK airport in New York. Flight search engines may not always "find" these routes, because they often require an overnight stay in NYC on your outbound leg: the flight leaves first thing in the morning.

Here's the method we used to find the **cheapest and best flights** from Boston, Burlington, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and San Franciso to Grenada.

* Go to Google Flights with [this link](https://www.google.com/flights#flt=BTV.GND.2019-03-14*GND.BTV.2019-03-18;c:USD;e:1;sd:1;t:f)

* Change your origin city to where you live

* Click the large "Dates" box (see example at right) and explore the pricing grid — in many cases, moving one of your dates forward or back by a day can dramatically reduce your price

* If Google Flights doesn't try routing you through JFK on JetBlue, you may want to try booking your flight as two separate roundtrips: one from your origin to JFK, and another from JFK to GND
