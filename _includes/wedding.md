Kenosha

The [Southport Light Station Museum](https://www.visitkenosha.com/things-to-do/southport-light-station-museum) is also a cool restored lighthouse and history museum that details Kenosha's presence as a 19th century harbor.
You can also check out the famous [Mars Cheese Castle](https://www.marscheese.com/), stroll through the [Civil War](https://museums.kenosha.org/civilwar/) and [Public](https://museums.kenosha.org/public/) Museums on the lakefront, or visit nearby **Milwaukee** or **Chicago**.

Racine
: Just up the road, **Racine** is home to one of Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpieces, the [SC Johnson Wax building](http://www.scjohnson.com/en/company/visiting.aspx), which offers tours. You can also walk/run along the city's [Root River](http://www.rootrivercouncil.org/experience-the-root/root-river-pathway/), take in the country's largest collection of contemporary craft art at the [Racine Art Museum](https://www.ramart.org/), or visit the dramatic [Wind Point Lighthouse](http://windpointlighthouse.org/).
