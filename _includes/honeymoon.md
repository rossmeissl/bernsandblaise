## Honeymoon

When
: **March 15–22, 2019**. Come anytime in this window and stay for as long as you'd like. Most people will come Friday March 15 and stay for a long weekend so they don't miss the [party](#party).

Where
: **Grenada, West Indies**. Grenada is a small island but most of what we plan to do is concentrated in Grand Anse Beach (on the Southwest corner of the island).

Think of this like a spring break trip where a bunch of your friends and family will also be there. Other than the [party](#party), there's no schedule, so you'll have plenty of time to relax and do your thing. But, if you are interested, we'll be compiling a list of excursions during the week that you can join us on as you wish, including rainforest hikes, tours of nutmeg and rum factories, and snorkeling.

You are welcome to come earlier and/or stay later, but we will be AWOL after March 22nd (for our own “mini-moon”).
