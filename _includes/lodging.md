## Lodging

The best guide to Grenada's hotels we've found is at [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/grenada/hotels/). There are also a wide range of AirBnBs available.

We're staying at Mount Cinnamon Resort, but as long as you pick a spot on/near Grand Anse beach, it's all walkable. There are frequent buses from Grand Anse up to St. George's, the capital city.
