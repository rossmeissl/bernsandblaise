The best guide to Grenada's hotels we've found is at [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/grenada/hotels/).

Even if you don't stay with us at the **Mount Cinnamon Resort**, weâ€™d still love for you to stay near us on **Grand Anse Beach**, where there are a variety of other hotels, resorts, and Airbnbs available. The Grand Anse Beach area is all walkable and there are frequent buses from there up to St. George's, the capital city.

Mount Cinnamon
: We have a block rate at [Mount Cinnamon Resort](https://mountcinnamongrenadahotel.com/) for **20% off** if you book direct. If you're comfortable with a *non-refundable rate* you can save even more. There are multi-bedroom units available if you want to share a spot with friends. Reach out to our pal [Odissa](mailto:reservations@mountcinnamongrenada.com) and use reference number **ROSS031619**. You will probably **not get a good rate** if you try using their website: it's best to contact Odissa directly. Expect $289/night for one of their Cinnamon Suites. It's not a huge resort so book soon if you want to stay here. 

Radisson
: We block rate at the nearby [Radisson Grenada Beach Resort](https://www.radisson.com/st-georges-hotel-gd/grdgrgr) which is a bigger and more affordable option. Call (800) 333-3333 or [book online](https://www.radisson.com) using promotional code **1903HUDD** under the "More Search Options" section. Note that this block has a cutoff date of **Tuesday, Feb 12, 2019**. [Room options](http://www.radisson.com/st-georges-hotel-gd/grdgrgr/rooms?language=EN) include 2 double beds for **$96**/night, premium king for **$133**/night, premium 2 doubles for **$199**, and ocean view king for **$248**.

Airbnb
: There is a thriving Airbnb scene throughout the Caribbean. Check out the [listings](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Grand-Anse-Beach--Grenada) for more info.
