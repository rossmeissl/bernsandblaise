## Lodging

The best guide to Grenada's hotels we've found is at [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/grenada/hotels/).

Even if you don't stay with us at the **Mount Cinnamon Resort**, weâ€™d still love for you to stay near us on **Grand Anse Beach**, where there are a variety of other hotels, resorts, and Airbnbs available. The Grand Anse Beach area is all walkable and there are frequent buses from there up to St. George's, the capital city.

Mount Cinnamon
: We have a block rate at [Mount Cinnamon Resort](https://mountcinnamongrenadahotel.com/) for 20% off if you book direct. There are multi-bedroom units available if you want to share a spot with friends. Reach out to our pal [Odissa](mailto:reservations@mountcinnamongrenada.com) and use reference number **ROSS031619**.

Blue Horizons
: Steps away from Mount Cinnamon is the mid-range [Blue Horizons Garden Resort](https://www.grenadabluehorizons.com/en-us). We don't have a block rate here (yet) but the prices are reasonable without one.

Radisson
: We also have a block rate available at the [Radisson Grenada Beach Resort](https://www.radisson.com/st-georges-hotel-gd/grdgrgr) which is a more affordable option. Call (800) 333-3333 or [book online](https://www.radisson.com) using promotional code **1903HUDD** under the "More Search Options" section. Note that this block has a cutoff date of **Tuesday, Feb 12, 2019**.

Airbnb
: There is a thriving Airbnb scene throughout the Caribbean. Some units even include housekeeping and a cook! Check out the [listings](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Grand-Anse-Beach--Grenada) for more info.
