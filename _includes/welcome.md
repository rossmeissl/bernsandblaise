## Welcome

When
: **Friday, March 15, 2019** 4–7pm. Please try to be at **Nimrod's Rum Shack** by **4pm**. Water taxis will take us from Nimrod's to Roger's between 4–5pm and back to Nimrod's around 7:15pm.

Where
: **Roger's Barefoot Bar, Hog Island**.

How
: It's easiest to take a **taxi** to Nimrod's from your hotel (arrange a time for your taxi driver to come back and pick you up from Nimrod's after). But the adventurous can take **any bus into St. George's** and then hop on the **#2 bus** and ask to be dropped off at Nimrod's (which doubles as a bus stop).

What
: Roger will serve drinks and apps at his beach bar for us, then feel free to get dinner wherever you'd like.

Who
: **No children, please**. We'll have information forthcoming on what to do with your kiddos.

Dress
: Casual.
