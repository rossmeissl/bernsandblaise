{% include savvys.html %}

When
: **March 16, 2019 at 5:30pm**. Things should be wrapped up by midnight.

Where
: **Beach Cabana, Mount Cinnamon Resort**.

What
: **Food, drink and music**. There will also be a **ceremony**.

Who
: **No young children, please**. We'll have information forthcoming on what to do with your kiddos.

Dress
: **Beach semi-formal**. More than jeans, less than tuxedos.

We're getting married in a tiny chapel in Wisconsin that's a memorial to Sara Blaise's grandmother. There's only enough room for family, so this is our chance to celebrate with all of you.
