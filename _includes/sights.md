## Sights

It would take you about 2.5 hours to drive all the way around Grenada. Within this small island of about 100 square miles, you'll find a little of everything.

General
: Grenada being a destination for Brits, The [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/grenada/articles/grenada-travel-guide/) has a good overview.
: [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/grenada) has a good guide, and if you're looking for a **book**, their [Caribbean Islands](http://a.co/d/aHDdYD8) offering was updated just last year.
: [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/north-america/grenada/top-things-to-do/) gives a good rundown.

St. George's
: Widely considered the most beautiful **capital city** in the Caribbean. It's a short bus ride up from Grande Anse beach. Here's an [overview](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/grenada/grenada-island/st-georges) from Lonely Planet.
: The **Carenage** is a scenic inlet in St. George's harbor, perfect for strolling around and taking in the brightly colored architecture.
: [Fort Frederick](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/grenada/st-georges/attractions/fort-frederick/a/poi-sig/1395090/358047) is the island's best-preserved fort: originally French, then used by the British.
: [Fort George](http://www.puregrenada.com/explore/attractions/historic-sites/fort-george/#.W6MVp9hKh0s) is the oldest defensive structure in Grenada.
: The [Grenada National Museum](http://www.puregrenada.com/explore/attractions/historic-sites/grenada-national-museum/#.W6MV6thKh0s) is a bit jumbled but worth a visit if you're in the area.

Hiking
: Hiking is the perfect way to experience what The Telegraph calls the [greenest island in the Caribbean](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/grenada/articles/hiking-the-best-way-to-see-grenada/). The information we've read suggests that it's generally best to use a local guide.
: The [Grand Etang](https://www.bradtguides.com/destinations/north-america-caribbean/grenada/grand-etang-national-park.html) **Forest Reserve** and **National Park** comprise over 6,000 acres of mountainous rainforest. For a true summit hike, try [Mount Qua Qua](https://www.summitpost.org/mount-qua-qua/970228). Here's [another account](https://actoutwithaislinn.bangordailynews.com/2016/01/12/one-minute-hikes/1-minute-hike-mount-qua-qua-in-grenada/).

Nature

Check out [Lake Antoine](http://www.puregrenada.com/explore/attractions/eco-sites/lake-antoine/), [Levera National Park](http://www.puregrenada.com/explore/attractions/eco-sites/levera-national-park/), or the [Mt.

Rum

: One-third of the world's **nutmeg** is produced in Grenadaâ€”you can smell it everywhere.

The market is open every day but is most exciting on Saturday mornings.

Bars
: We've done a lot of research on the best beach (and elsewhere) bars in Grenada. Here's what we've found so far.
: [Roger's Barefoot Beach Bar](https://www.facebook.com/Rogers-Barefoot-Beach-Bar-279452722107143/) on Hog Island can only be reached by boat or by foot. The best instructions I've found are on [this page](https://www.goatsontheroad.com/travel-guide-best-beaches-grenada/) (scroll down to Hog Island).

: [Umbrella's](http://www.jayeatz.com/blog/so-its-sunny-out-and-you-cant-find-shade-head-for-an-umbrella-umbrellas-beach-bar-in-grenada) is much more of a "real bar" than the others on this list.
: [La Plywood](http://laplywood.restaurantwebx.com/) is on Mourne Rouge/BBC beach just south of Grand Anse. 
: [La Luna](http://www.laluna.com/indulge/grenada-bars/) is quite a bit fancier than the others here.

Breweries
