It would take you about 2.5 hours to drive all the way around Grenada. Within this small island of about 100 square miles and 100,000 people, you'll find a little of everything.

St. George's

Hiking
: Hiking is the perfect way to experience what The Telegraph calls the [greenest island in the Caribbean](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/grenada/articles/hiking-the-best-way-to-see-grenada/). The information we've read suggests that it's generally best to use a local guide.
: The [Grand Etang](https://www.bradtguides.com/destinations/north-america-caribbean/grenada/grand-etang-national-park.html) **Forest Reserve** and **National Park** comprise over 6,000 acres of mountainous rainforest.

Tours

Beaches
: Here's our favorite rundown of the [best beaches on the island](https://www.goatsontheroad.com/travel-guide-best-beaches-grenada/). There's also a great list from [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/grenada/articles/grenada-beaches/).

Nature
: If you're not up for the hike, you can still visit [Grant Etang Lake](http://www.puregrenada.com/explore/attractions/eco-sites/grand-etang-lake/).
: **Birdwatching** is increasingly popular on Grenada. Check out [Lake Antoine](http://www.puregrenada.com/explore/attractions/eco-sites/lake-antoine/), [Levera National Park](http://www.puregrenada.com/explore/attractions/eco-sites/levera-national-park/), or the [Mt. Hartman Dove Sanctuary](http://www.puregrenada.com/explore/attractions/eco-sites/mt-hartman-dove-sancturay/), home of the Grenada Dove. Here's a [brochure](http://www.caribbeanbirdingtrail.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Brochure-for-Grenada-and-Map.pdf) from the Caribbean Birding Trail with a list of the best birdwatching sites and birding guides.
: If **botanical gardens** are your thing, visit [Hyde Park](https://www.hydeparkgrenada.com/where-to-find-us.html) or [Jessamine's Eden](http://www.jessamine-eden.com/).

Rum
: The **River Antoine Rum Distillery** has been in continuous operation since 1785 using local sugar cane along with oxen and water power to crush the cane. Here's a great [video](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/video/just-back-from-tasting-rum-in-grenada/v/vid/671) from Lonely Planet.
: More well-known rum producers in Grenada include [Clarke's Court](http://www.clarkescourtrum.com/about-us) and [Westerhall Estate](http://www.grenadagrenadines.com/explore/attractions/historic-sites/westerhall-estate/). 

Spices and Chocolate
: [Belmont Estate](http://www.belmontestate.net) has been producing **spices and chocolate** since the 1600s. The 400 acre plantation is now fully organic and includes sustainable farming, gardens, chocolate production, and tours. Belmont is **closed Saturdays**.
: One-third of the world's **nutmeg** is produced in Grenada—you can smell it everywhere. The best place to visit for the nutmeg experience is the [Gouyave Nutmeg Co-operative](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/grenada/gouyave/attractions/nutmeg-processing-cooperative/a/poi-sig/1395288/1331176) in the northwest corner of the island.
: Another great way to experience Grenada's spices is to visit the [Spice Market](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/food-and-wine/2017/04/06/spice-market-square-st-georges-grenada/100070154/) in St. George's [Market Square](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/grenada/st-georges/attractions/st-george-s-market-square/a/poi-sig/1395094/358052). The market is open every day but is most exciting on Saturday mornings.

Bars
: We've done a lot of research on the best beach (and elsewhere) bars in Grenada. Here's what we've found so far.
: [Roger's Barefoot Beach Bar](https://www.facebook.com/Rogers-Barefoot-Beach-Bar-279452722107143/) on Hog Island, where we're hosting a welcome party on Friday night, can only be reached by boat or by foot. The best instructions I've found are on [this page](https://www.goatsontheroad.com/travel-guide-best-beaches-grenada/) (scroll down to Hog Island). [More coverage](https://beachbarbums.com/2015/11/19/liming-the-day-away-at-rogers-beach-bar-in-grenada/).
: [Nimrod's Rum Shop](https://www.facebook.com/Nimrods-Rum-Shop-171746412936916/) is a classic Caribbean rum shack that also serves as a bus stop.
: [Esther's Beach Bar](https://www.facebook.com/esthers.beachbar) is on Grand Anse.
: [Umbrella's](http://www.jayeatz.com/blog/so-its-sunny-out-and-you-cant-find-shade-head-for-an-umbrella-umbrellas-beach-bar-in-grenada) is much more of a "real bar" than the others on this list.
: [La Plywood](http://laplywood.restaurantwebx.com/) is on Mourne Rouge/BBC beach just south of Grand Anse. 
: [La Luna](http://www.laluna.com/indulge/grenada-bars/) is quite a bit fancier than the others here.

Breweries
: [Carib Brewery](http://www.caribbrewery.com/brewery-2/grenada) is what the locals drink when they're not drinking rum. It's originally from Trinidad & Tobago but they also have a brewery on Grenada.
: **West Indies Beer Co.** opened their [Brewery](http://www.westindiesbeer.com/bar.html) recently to much fanfare.

Water activities
: **Snorkling** is a big deal in Grenada, with the world's first [underwater sculpture park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/grenada/st-georges/attractions/underwater-sculpture-park/a/poi-sig/1555233/358047) and the Grenada Marine Protected Area just north of St. George's. [Here's a list](http://caribya.com/grenada/snorkeling/).
: You can also go **diving** and explore huge shipwrecks and coral reefs. Here's a [list of dive sites](https://www.divegrenada.com/sites.htm) and another from [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/grenada/in-location/activities/a/nar/5b0cbad0-d52c-4564-aa6a-8786c80fe2e7/358047).
